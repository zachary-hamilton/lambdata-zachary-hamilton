Thanks for your comments on my repo. Totally forgot doc strings and to adjust the longer lines of code. I appreciate that.

Comments:
1. Nice job implementing class in your code. I had a hard time figuring out how to incorporate class into my own functions. Nicely done.
2. Runs perfect in Colab.
3. Good in-line comments. Easy to understand without running the code.
4. Sweet use of lambda functions.

Overall, great job. I don't really have any suggestions.
